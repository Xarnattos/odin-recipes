        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces farfalle pasta</li>
            <li>3 strips bacon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups frozen petite peas</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly-squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add farfalle and cook until tender with a bite, about 11 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water to thin the sauce later if needed.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon; cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel to drain. When cool enough to handle, crumble and set aside. Remove bacon grease from skillet.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and butter in the skillet over medium heat; add mushrooms and onions. Cook until onions are translucent and the moisture in mushrooms is starting to evaporate, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low, stir in half-and-half, peas, and thyme. Bring to a gentle simmer, and cook until peas are heated through and sauce has started to thicken, 3 to 4 minutes. If sauce is too thick, add a little reserved pasta water to thin.</li>
            <li>Stir in lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, garnish with crumbled bacon and chopped parsley, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
